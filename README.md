# Wearable Workout Data Visualization

This project provides an automated Python pipeline for visualizing wearable sensor data (Accelerometer and Gyroscope). It is designed to analyze 3D movement during strength training exercises (like squats, bench presses, and rows) and automatically generate performance dashboards for different participants and workout sets.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Loads pre-processed time-series sensor data from a Pandas Pickle (`.pkl`) format.
- **Granular Filtering:** Easily isolate data by exercise type (`label`), user (`participant`), or workout set (`set`).
- **Multi-Axis Plotting:** Visualizes movement in 3D space by mapping `acc_x`, `acc_y`, and `acc_z` (or gyroscope equivalents) on shared axes.
- **Automated Dashboard Generation:** Uses loops to automatically generate, format, and save 2-panel subplots (Accelerometer vs. Gyroscope) for every participant and exercise combination.
- **High-Quality Export:** Plots are styled using the `seaborn-v0_8-deep` theme and exported as high-resolution (100 DPI) PNG files.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

```

## Usage

1. Ensure your processed data file is located at `../../data/interim/01_data_processed.pkl` relative to where you run the script.
2. Ensure the destination folder `../../reports/figures/` exists, or the script will throw a "File Not Found" error when saving the images.
3. Run the script in your IDE, Jupyter Notebook, or via the command line.
4. The script will display individual plots dynamically and save the final combined dashboard images into the `reports/figures/` directory.

## Known Data Requirements

The input `.pkl` file must be a Pandas DataFrame containing at least the following columns:

- `set`: (int) The workout set number.
- `label`: (str) The name of the exercise (e.g., 'squat', 'bench', 'row').
- `participant`: (str) The ID of the person performing the exercise (e.g., 'A', 'B').
- `category`: (str) Weight category (e.g., 'heavy', 'medium').
- `acc_x`, `acc_y`, `acc_z`: (float) Accelerometer readings.
- `gyro_x`, `gyro_y`, `gyro_z`: (float) Gyroscope readings.
